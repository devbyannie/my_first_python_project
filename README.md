# My First Python Project: Guess the Number

This is my first project written in Python. It's a simple command-line game where the user tries to guess a secret number between 1 and 100.

## How to Run This Project
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer.
2. Download the `game.py` file from this repository.
3. Open a terminal in the folder where you saved the file.
4. Run the command: `python game.py`

## What I Learned
* The basics of Python: variables, loops (`while`), and conditional logic (`if/elif/else`).
* How to get user input from the terminal.
* The core workflow of Git and GitHub: committing and pushing changes.
